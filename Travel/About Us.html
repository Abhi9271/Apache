Nurtured from the seed of a single great idea - to empower the traveller – Extra Mile Travel&reg; is a pioneer in
India’s online travel industry. Founded in the year 2005, Extra Mile Travel&reg; came to life to empower the
Indian traveller with instant bookings and comprehensive choices. The company initiated its journey serving 
the India travel market offering a range of best-value products and services powered by technology and
round-the-clock customer support.

After consolidating its position in the market as a brand recognised for its reliability and transparency,
Extra Mile Travel&reg; launched its India operations in 2008. With more and more Indians initiating to transact
online with IRCTC and new opportunities with the advent of low cost carriers, we offered
travellers the convenience of booking travel online with a few clicks.

Extra Mile Travel&reg;’s rise has been led by the vision and the spirit of each one of its employees, for whom no
idea was too big and no problem too difficult. With untiring determination, Extra Mile Travel&reg; has proactively 
diversified its product offering, adding a variety of online and offline products and services. We have stayed 
ahead of the curve by continually evolving its technology to meet the ever-changing demands of the rapidly 
developing global travel market, steadily establishing ourselves as India’s leading online travel company.</pre></font>
